# Knowledge Wiki Repository

Welcome to the **Knowledge Wiki**, a personal knowledge base designed to capture, document, and organise valuable information on various technical subjects, such as **Python**, **AWS**, **Cloud Architecture**, and related domains. The purpose of this repository is to help deepen expertise through structured and well-researched notes, citations, and practical code examples.

## Repository Structure

The wiki is structured into multiple sections based on different topics, with each section covering subtopics relevant to the subject matter. The repository includes:

- **Markdown files**: These are the core wiki pages, documenting knowledge, best practices, and insights.
- **Code Examples**: All runnable code examples are stored in a separate folder (`examples/`) and linked directly from the wiki pages.
- **References & Citations**: External resources, including books, articles, and tutorials, are cited throughout the documentation.

### Folder Structure

```bash
/wiki
    /Topic1
        - Topic1.md
	    /assets
	        - image1.jpg
    /Topic2
        - Topic2.md
        /assets
	        - image2.png
/examples
	/Topic1
		- python_example.py
```

- **/wiki**: Contains all markdown files for different topics and asset files used within the respective page.
- **/examples**: Contains code examples that are referenced in the markdown files.

## Features

- **Organized by Topic**: The repository is divided into topic-specific sections (e.g., Python, AWS Lambda, AB Deployment), and within those sections are detailed subtopics covering various aspects.
- **Executable Code Examples**: Where appropriate, code snippets are included directly on the wiki pages, with full example files stored in the `/examples` folder for running or testing.
- **Best Practices & Pitfalls**: Each subtopic includes a section on common best practices and mistakes to avoid.
- **Citations**: Information is properly cited from books, articles, or other external resources to maintain accuracy and provide additional context for further reading.

## How to Use

1. **Load into Obsidian**: Load the repo into an Obsidian vault and install the necessary plugins.
2. **Explore Wiki Topics**: Navigate the repository to find topics and subtopics relevant to your area of interest. Each topic includes structured content with links to related topics and further resources.
3. **Run Code Examples**: Refer to the `examples/` folder for any runnable code examples mentioned in the wiki. These examples provide real-world use cases and hands-on practice.
4. **Citing External Resources**: Information drawn from external sources includes references, and all external links are clearly cited at the bottom of each wiki page.
